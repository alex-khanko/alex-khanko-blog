Another phrase that really shifted my mindset is "product thinking." 
It's when you truly understand why you're writing that code, 
why you're implementing that feature, 
and who actually needs it.

I heard this at an offline meetup a long time ago, 
and it was like a light bulb going off in my head. 

In that moment, 
I realized that as IT professionals, 
we're creating digital products for other humans, 
and our top priority should always be customer satisfaction.
