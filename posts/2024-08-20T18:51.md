Hey there! This is my first post on my personal GitHub blog.  
It seems like I'll be the only one reading it, but honestly, that's not a problem for me.  
A while back, I realized I needed a place to capture my thoughts and feelings about IT.  
And just by chance, I had some free time to think about where to do that (I'll definitely write an article on why I chose GitHub! :) )  

So, stay tuned!
