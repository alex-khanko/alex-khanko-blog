Today, I had an interesting thought about the comparison between responsibility and accountability.

Responsibility is about taking action according to a plan, while accountability is being answerable for the final result.

Iâ€™m convinced that every professional and their customer partner must clearly understand who is responsible for what in a project and who is accountable for the outcomes. 

If this line gets blurred, the project ends up with no one truly responsible or accountable.
