I just found a great alternative to traditional caches like Redis and Memcached â€” [DragonFly](https://github.com/dragonflydb/dragonfly)

I haven't tried it yet, but why not give it a shot during the next cache system implementation?
                                                                                                         
And it is very interesting to read theirs [background](https://github.com/dragonflydb/dragonfly?tab=readme-ov-file#background).
