I found it really interesting to learn that thereâ€™s a common standard for providing APIs for charging stations, 
specifically the [OCPI](https://chargelab.co/industry-advocacy/ocpi) and [OCPP](https://chargelab.co/industry-advocacy/ocpp) standards.

Most charging station providers and eMSPs use these protocols for communication, 
making integrations smooth and allowing for easy switching or adding of providers.
