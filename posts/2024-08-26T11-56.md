I recently discovered a new type of test! 
We’re all familiar with unit, integration, and E2E testing 
(and if you’re not, I recommend [that great resource](https://betterprogramming.pub/a-visual-tutorial-on-every-type-of-test-you-can-write-ec9b83edcf35)).

But there's another interesting one—architecture testing. 
This involves checking whether we have the right dependencies between modules or microservices 
and ensuring we're not using any unnecessary services or modules.

Right now, I’m doing these architecture tests manually during code reviews. 
I’ll share an automated technique in a future post once I’ve got it all set up! :)
