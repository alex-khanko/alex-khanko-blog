I had yet another moment when Windows drove me crazy with its Windows-specific bugs in Docker and scripting. 
That's when I decided to switch to using Linux-based VMs for each personal project I'm working on.

I chose Debian with the XFCE GUI because it's the most performant for my needs.

And thank goodness VMWare made Workstation Pro free for personal use. 
I initially wanted to use QEMU instead because it seemed more efficient, 
but I found it absolutely not user-friendly. 
I got stuck trying to customize the settings.

However, things might change for me soon. 
I’m on the lookout for a new laptop with an ARM processor, 
and since VMWare doesn’t support ARM (and likely won’t, probably due to its acquisition by Broadcom), 
QEMU might just make a comeback in my workflow.

Oh, I just remembered Hyper-V! 
I'll definitely make sure my next laptop comes with Windows 11 Pro so I can take advantage of that.
