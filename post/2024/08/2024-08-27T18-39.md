Some time ago, 
I found myself puzzled by philosophical questions like 
"What is the purpose of my activities?", 
"What makes me happy?", 
and "How can I make the world a better place?"

Then I came across the concept of ["Ikigai" and its graphic representation](https://hyperisland.com/en/blog/thought-leadership/feeling-drained-at-work). 
And I found it useful.
