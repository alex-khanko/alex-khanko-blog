I was really shocked today to learn that [Microsoft is deprecating support for Windows Subsystem for Android](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/windows-11-will-stop-supporting-android-apps-in-2025-here-s-why/ar-BB1jot2D). 
And this is happening right alongside the release of the Windows tablet, the Surface Pro 11 on ARM. Itâ€™s completely inexplicable!

Thank goodness we have [support from the open-source community](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds)!
