It feels like a new revolution is happening in how I approach programming and implementation.

A while ago, I came across the concept of the rich domain model and its [comparison to the anemic one](https://medium.com/@inzuael/anemic-domain-model-vs-rich-domain-model-78752b46098f). 
Even [Martin Fowler labeled the anemic model as an anti-pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html).

The reason I hadn’t heard much about the rich domain model earlier is probably due to my career path. I’ve worked on a lot of Java stack projects, and all of them were implemented in an anemic way.

But recently, I joined a Telegram chat where most of the members are Senior+ specialists discussing System Design. 
A lot of them come from the C# stack, and that’s where I first heard about the rich domain model and the [DDD trilemma](https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/posts/domain-model-purity-completeness/).

It’s some really interesting food for thought, and I’m eager to try this approach in practice!
